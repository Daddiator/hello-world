        Deep within a tiny, nested, super-cluster of galaxies, in its 451st largest galactic subset-cluster,
        in its 6th largest member galaxy, known as the Milky-Way, which contains at least 100 billion 
        star systems, there is a mid-sized star, known as "The Sun", and in its 
        3rd planetary orbit, is my home planet ("Earth").  You are unlikely to find me here, because even I 
        don't really know where I am.
        
        However, if by some miracle you do reach Earth, I have one recomendation: Gather as many 
        "Moon Pies" as you can.  You'll need to do research on how to safely obtain Moon
        Pies, by the ton. Note: Moon Pies should NOT be confused with "Moon Tacos". Moon Pies are originally an 
        Earth snack food. So despite the name, you're not likely to find them on 
        the Moon.* 
        
        * The Moon" is a naturally-occurring satelite, orbitting the planet Earth.
          
        Unlike Moon Pies, Moon Tacos are not known to be found on the planet Earth.  
        They are instead reportedly found exclusively on the Moon.  I'm not a much of a taco eater. Furthermore, Moon travel is 
        quite expensive these days and beyond my budget. So I have not yet personally had the "Moon Taco" experience.
        The information regarding the availability,  and gastronomic superiority of Moon Tacos, 
        was provided by a very reliable source.
