    Joseph Thomas: QOU469
   
   I was born in a tiny super-cluster of galaxies, within the 3rd largest galaxy,
    locally referred to as Milky-Way galaxy,  within which I live in on the 3rd planet, 
    orbiting a mid-sized star, known locally to as "The Sun".  If you happen to visit this planet, 
    which many of it in habitant call Earth, Do try Moon Pies, If like a sweet treats. 
    They're originally an Earth snack food, so despite the name you're not likely to find on 
    Moon.  "The Moon"is the name given to the only naturally-occurring satelite orbitting the planet Earth.
    Not be confused with "Moon Tacos",  of which, I have no first hand experience.
